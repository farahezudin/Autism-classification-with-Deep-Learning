Classification of Adults with Autism Spectrum Disorder using Deep Neural Network

Abstract:

Autism Spectrum Disorder (ASD) is a brain developmental disorder that causes deficits in linguistic, communicative and cognitive skills as well as social skills. Various application of Machine Learning has been applied apart from the clinical tests available, which has increase the performance in diagnosis of this disorder. In this study, the implementation of Deep Learning is applied by using the Deep Neural Network (DNN) classifier. The aim of this study is to analyze the performance of DNN model in classifying diagnosis of ASD in terms of classification accuracy by using two datasets of adult ASD screening data. The results is then compared with the previous Machine Learning method worked by other researcher which is Support Vector Machine (SVM).
